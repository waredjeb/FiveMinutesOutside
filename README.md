# FiveMinutesOutside

A 2D pixel-art survival (?) game: pop-ups keep appearing, tasks pile up, and your stress bar climbs.  
The only cure? Step outside for five minutes (if you can)

## Status
Just started, still learning everything ...

README will get expanded once the core gameplay loop is stable (yes, really!).

## The idea (still not have a clear idea as well, I just want to see how it goes for now)

- You walk around
- Pop-up windows appear (errors, requests, quiz(?))
- Solving them keeps you alive, but stress increases over time (still not sure I like this ...)
- High stress = harder (blur, shake, moving windows, some other frustrating stuff)
- Reduce stress by leaving the place and taking a break outside (take a tea, smoke a cig)

- Style: **2D pixel art**
